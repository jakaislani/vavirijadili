Survivor 41 and 42 were filmed in 2021 and 43 and 44 were filmed in 2022, so it is safe to assume that Survivor 45 and Survivor 46 were filmed earlier this year.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>As for the filming location, rather than jumping from place to place like the franchise did in the past, Survivor‘s permanent location (at least for now) is Mamanuca Islands, Fiji.

Even though he was medically evacuated early on in his season, Probst is giving him the opportunity to join the cast for Survivor 45.</p><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>“In the spirit of what&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;is all about, getting up off the couch, leaving your ordinary world behind — your family, your friends — left to fend for yourself in the jungle and say yes to adventure, I don’t think Bruce got his fair share of&nbsp;Survivor,” the Emmy Award-winning host teased on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">On Fire with Jeff Probst</a> podcast back in March. “Here’s the announcement.
