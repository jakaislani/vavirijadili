But while the director is at home with the film’s apocalyptic themes, the family drama feels forced, neglecting to ground its characters convincingly within the walls of the apartment where the action takes place.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Charlie (Fraser) teaches online writing courses from his home, which he no longer leaves, with his camera off. He is obese, and it’s unclear if it’s a cause or effect of his hermit lifestyle. He has a near-death experience while watching porn with his blood pressure spiking but is saved by a young missionary who happens to knock on his door at the right or wrong time. Charlie wants nothing to do with god in his time of need, but instead, frantically demands the confused young man to read an essay on Moby Dick out loud.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>It’s not particularly evident what Moby Dick has to do with Charlie’s life beyond that he is big and whales are big (get it?). If there’s a counterpart in classical literature, it’s certainly A Christmas Carol, as over the course of The Whale, we learn that Charlie isn’t a great guy and even his attempts at making amends screw other people over in the process. But for Charlie and his rotating visitors, redemption is never out of the question.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Charlie’s friend, a charmingly brusque nurse named Liz played by Hong Chau, shows up in a panic and after checking his vitals, lets him know his days are numbered if he doesn’t go to the hospital. Charlie, who has no health insurance, refuses, and Liz is equal parts gutted and exasperated. As the one person truly invested in his life, she serves as an audience surrogate.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>After their first encounter, the missionary becomes something of a regular house guest, continuing to urge Charlie to save his soul. He’s at odds with Liz, who doesn’t trust his sunny demeanor or his church and tries to keep him away, hoping her friend can be saved in this life.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Charlie, meanwhile, is occupied trying to mend his relationship with his estranged daughter Ellie, played by Stranger Things‘ Sadie Sink, who he reaches out to, knowing it’s his last chance. The surly teen is a great writer but a bad student, and Charlie hopes some tutoring and bribery will make up for missing her childhood. Later, Ellie’s mom (Samantha Morton), tries to make sense of their brief marriage.</p><p data-characters=1103 data-current-count=1103 data-injectable=true>There has been some controversy over the decision to cast Fraser and put the actor in a fat suit. Aronofsky’s reasoning was that he tried to cast a bigger actor, but couldn’t find one good enough, which isn’t good enough. While Fraser’s performance is great, the film itself doesn’t have anything profound to say about obesity and that, combined with the casting choice, suggests a lack of curiosity. There are many ways to tell a story about a shut-in with health issues, but this is the choice they made, and the movie doesn’t provide insight to justify such an increasingly frowned-upon practice of putting actors in fat suits. Charlie’s relationship with his body feels so oversimplified. When his body is directly addressed, it is treated as something he is doing to people, which could have been interesting to actually explore, but this movie doesn’t. Although a director can’t exactly control viewers’ reactions, it’s telling that during my screening, audiences went for cheap laughs like Charlie opening a drawer full of candy.</p><p data-characters=674 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>The movie has drawn praise, which hopefully will encourage studios that a movie centering on an obese person’s experience from their perspective is worth making. It’s a good thing that prosthetics allow actors to transform, but murky when that is the only way for people whose bodies don’t fit Hollywood’s mold to be depicted on screen. It’s certainly nothing new for these stories to be told by more traditional movie stars before they’re ever allowed to be in the hands of people with lived experience. The movie has no obligation to right the sins of Hollywood’s past, but it’s certainly careless if empathy was the point.</p><p data-characters=651 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>The Whale is based on a play by Samuel D. Hunter, who also wrote the screenplay, and more care could have been taken adapting it from the stage. Charlie only goes out to his porch to collect deliveries and apartment, people shuffle in and out under the assumption they understand each other’s motivations when it’s clearly not the case. It’s a credit to Aronofsky that he didn’t expand the scope of the production beyond the single location in an effort to make it more cinematic, and he takes advantage of the medium to capture Fraser’s facial expressions, which do more to tell Charlie’s story than the dialogue.</p><p data-characters=628 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>The controversies of the movie should not overshadow that it’s just bad storytelling. As the motley crew comes and goes, they each reveal their great psychic wound in a dramatic monologue, boiling things down to some version of hurt people hurt people each time. The exposition errs on the side of heavy-handedness, and here, it’s evident that not enough care was taken adapting the work for the screen, where there’s more room to be subtle when showing not telling. For Aronofsky, it’s grounded work, but if the point was to make an understated film, the divisive director did not rise to the occasion.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Fraser’s performance has already set the actor up for awards show consideration, and he’s deserving of the recognition, as is Chau. But The Whale is a frustrating watch as Aronofsky doesn’t seem to trust the actors or the audience, squashing the potential to tell an intriguing story.</p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>The Whale is in select theaters Dec. 9 (NY/LA) and opens nationwide Dec. 21</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-half></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Middling</h5><p class=review-summary>Though Brendan Fraser's performance is phenomenal, the script itself was poorly adapted for the screen, giving what could be a great movie a heavy-handedness that undercuts the excellent performances.</p><p class=review-title>The Whale</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeimsOqsdasZq2glWLEqa3LnmSbqpWjsaK6jJ%2BpmquVp3qlrdGrnKdlkae8r7vFrKKyZaKaw6qx1mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-teenager-callie-rogers-blew-a-36-million-lotto-win.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How teenager Callie Rogers blew a $3.6 million lotto win</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ape-shall-not-kill-ape-a-look-at-the-entire-apes-franchise.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ape Shall Not Kill Ape: A Look at the Entire Apes Franchise | Far Flungers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
