The shooter has been named John Madore, who allegedly took the life of Bradley Haas Franklin, a dedicated security guard at the facility.</p><p>In a shocking incident at New Hampshire Hospital in Concord, a gunman unleashed a hail of bullets in the front lobby, putting the lives of staff and patients at risk. Among those caught in the terrifying ordeal was Bradley Haas, a 63-year-old security officer diligently carrying out his duties at the time. In a tragic turn of events, Haas has succumbed to his injuries despite the valiant efforts made to save his life. In a tragic incident, John Madore was fatally shot by a state trooper who had been assigned to the hospital.</p><p>Haas worked for the Department of Safety during the shooting incident. In a noteworthy career trajectory, he dedicated an impressive 28 years to the Franklin, NH, police department. Commencing as a diligent patrol officer, he steadily ascended the ranks and ultimately assumed the esteemed position of chief. In 2008, he made the decision to retire from the department. In addition, he was a U.S. Army veteran.</p><p>In a press conference held on Saturday morning, Attorney General John Formella declared Chief Haas a true hero. Chief Haas, who had already earned recognition for his dedicated service to the country, state, and community, tragically lost his life while safeguarding patients, staff, and visitors at New Hampshire Hospital.</p><p>According to Formella, Haas has been employed as a security guard at the hospital since 2019. In a typical display of his role, he was found to be unarmed. At the time of the shooting, it was observed that there were additional individuals present within the lobby. However, it is worth noting that no further injuries were reported among these individuals.</p><p>According to Formella, it is believed that without the actions of Bradley Haas and the trooper on the scene, the situation could have potentially escalated to a much more severe outcome.</p><p>In a recent social media post, Governor Chris Sununu expressed his heartfelt condolences to the family of Haas.</p><p>During a press conference held on Saturday, he publicly recognized and commended Hass for his dedicated years of service and his courageous efforts in safeguarding the well-being of others.</p><p>Governor Sununu praised Haas as an unwavering public servant and state employee who made the ultimate sacrifice while safeguarding patients and staff at New Hampshire Hospital.</p><p>In a statement released today, the Franklin Police Department announced its decision to lower its flags to half-staff and have its officers wear mourning bands on their badges.</p><p>In a recent development, Robert L. Quinn, the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Safety, has issued a statement expressing his heartfelt condolences to the family of Haas.</p><p>In a statement released today, the New Hampshire Department of Safety expressed their deepest sympathies to the family, friends, and colleagues of Security Officer Bradley Haas. Officer Haas, a dedicated member of the safety team, tragically lost his life while heroically protecting the patients and staff of New Hampshire Hospital. Quinn expressed deep sorrow over the loss, stating, “Our hearts ache.”</p><p>The investigation into the shooting, including the potential motivation behind the incident, is still ongoing. According to officials, there is no current threat to the public, as stated on Saturday.</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services has set up a call center for family members of New Hampshire Hospital patients and staff seeking updates on their loved ones. This call center will continue to operate until further notice.</p><p>According to reports, the phone number in question has been identified as 603-271-3004.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h7yaifp2WdlrGwvsRmmqimk6S%2FpXnNoWShp6OltrWty2aqoaefqbavs4ysrKyolZjBbq3NnWSvoZOptq55zZqknmWimrmmrdKem2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-wahlburg-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Wahlburg Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./am4-motherboard-apu-bios-updates.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>AM4 Motherboard BIOS Updates Released to Support AMD Ryzen APUs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
