All I wanted was to get out on that property,” Robyn confessed.</p><p>As we know, Christine has already sold her Flagstaff home and moved into a new home with her fiance David Woolley in Utah, Meri has reportedly been living in her Parowan, Utah B&B, Lizzie’s Heritage Inn, and Janelle is seemingly still planning to build a 1,200-square-foot home on her property on Coyote Pass.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Janelle showed Christine her building plans during Episode 1 and, at the time of filming Season 18, was still adamant about living out the rest of her years on Coyote Pass. Whether or not she’s stuck with her original plan remains to be seen, especially since it would be awfully awkward to be living in close proximity to her ex-husband and his wife, Robyn.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-no-new-building-permits-have-been-filed-for-coyote-pass-despite-janelle-s-plans-to-construct-a-home-on-her-parcel>No new building permits have been filed for Coyote Pass despite Janelle’s plans to construct a home on her parcel</h2><p>Despite Janelle’s plans, The Sun reports that there are no new building permits that have been filed in Arizona for the four parcels of land at Coyote Pass.</p><p>As Monsters and Critics previously reported, Christine <a href=#>signed over her parcel of land</a> to Kody and Robyn for just $10, a move that seemed to indicate she wanted to wash her hands of any and all ties to her ex-husband.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As Christine told TLC’s cameras during a confessional in Episode 1, “I think if Janelle wants to build, then she should definitely build. The thing is, I know that they haven’t paid off the property.”</p><p>While Janelle admitted that she wasn’t sure the family had the ability to pay off the property, Kody admitted that coming up with the cash to pay off Coyote Pass would be “very difficult” while coming up with a down payment on a house would be “not hard.”</p><p>According to records obtained by <a href=#>The Sun</a>, however, it looks as though Kody and Janelle were able to come up with the funds and paid their $340,000 note in full on June 2, 2023, as well as an additional plot in Robyn’s name which was purchased for $170,000.</p><p>Since Janelle split from Kody in 2022, it’s unclear whether she’s going to stick to her guns and build on Coyote Pass or come up with new living arrangements somewhere far away from Kody and Robyn.</p><p>Sister Wives airs on Sundays at 10/9c on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6OewLWx0Wauoq6VqHqku9Spo55lm6SxunnAp5tmqp%2BXxq95waumsKZdo7a5ec%2BlmKerXam8bq7UoqOdZZ%2BjeqS72KirnmWglsC0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-blacklist-finale-will-go-down-as-one-of-the-worst-endings-ever-for-a-successful-series.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Blacklist finale will go down as one of the worst endings ever for a successful series</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-reynolds-expresses-his-admiration-for-bts-and-stray-kids-on-twitter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Reynolds Expresses His Admiration For BTS And Stray Kids On Twitter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
