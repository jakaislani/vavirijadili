Now, they seek to apprehend him and make him pay for all of his crimes. No more chasing Reddington’s list; time to chase him.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Of course, it’s turns out not to be so simple to catch him; he has built relationships with many of the people on the task force, and as the show built to its conclusion last night, no one was sure whether Reddington would escape, or be apprehended by the task force, or if he would be killed by them, if he would kill whoever attempted to apprehend him, or if he would be let go. Many twists and turns during the two-hour finale made you believe in any of those possibilities.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Blacklist series finale ending was HORRIBLE….makes The Sopranos ending look brilliant by comparison!!!

Ressler, played by Diego Klattenhoff, followed a lead to Spain, which was more of a theory than a lead, but it proved accurate. Too early — or so it appeared —we were about to see a one-on-one showdown. Earlier in the finale, Reddington had shot Ressler to get away, but intentionally aimed his shot at his bulletproof vest. Now that Ressler is about to find him, how will he react? Will he help him get away? Will Reddington shoot him fatally this time?</p><p data-characters=26 data-current-count=26 data-injectable=false>We were about to find out.</p><p data-characters=26 data-current-count=52 data-injectable=false>Then the absurd happened .</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wasted a decade of my life for a lame ass ending of The Blacklist?

That’s it. He was killed by a bull.

Why? Likely because the writers couldn’t decide what to do. It was a cop-out, and they denied viewers a final showdown.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Love it or hate it, with "The Blacklist" ending I am really going to miss <a href=#>#JamesSpader</a>'s portrayal of Raymond Reddington.

There is no way that they decided years ago that this series will end with Reddington being killed by a bull. One can safely assume “Yeah, that’s it. Great ending! Let’s lead towards that!” was never spoken by any of the writers.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=743 data-injectable=true>Why no long-term plan? Probably because the writers of the show were talented enough not to need one. Per episode, they are outstanding. Per season, pretty solid. But it can all come crashing down with a truly horrible ending. The sad part about it is they were pulling it off — despite not really tying up all loose ends — and it was about to be a memorable ending until it suddenly fell flat.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>That was the worst ending to a series ever and a disservice to everyone who stuck through 10 seasons.

Just like those two shows, The Blacklist will be remembered both for being a great series and having a horrible ending, which likely lessens it’s desire to be rewatched or, for that matter, watched for the first time by those who hear about the end, one that’s a great injustice to the excellent 10-year run of the show.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>In my final conclusion, I’ll leave you with some unforgettable words that will satisfy you in a way the show’s ending failed to.
