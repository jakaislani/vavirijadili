They had been dating for over 16 years until they married in 2007.</strong></p><p>Let us shed some light on Mark Gastineau and JoAnn Gastineau’s amazing love tale. Mark Gastineau was born on November 20, 1956, in Ardmore, Oklahoma, to parents Ernie and Lou Gastineau. He is a retired American football player best known for his exceptional career as a defensive lineman for the National Football League’s (NFL) New York Jets.</p><p>Gastineau excelled at East Central University before being picked in the first round of the 1979 NFL Draft by the New York Jets. In the early 1980s, he established himself as a fearsome NFL pass rusher. After sacking opposing quarterbacks, his aggressive demeanor inspired the sack dance celebration.</p><p>The 1984 AFC Defensive Player of the Year set an NFL record with 22 sacks, which was subsequently broken by Michael Strahan in 2000. Other highlights of his career include being voted the 1982 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, winning five Pro Bowls, and leading the NFL in sacks twice.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_JoAnn_Gastineau_Mark_Gastineaus_Wife>Who Is JoAnn Gastineau, Mark Gastineau’s Wife?</span></h2><p>Mark Gastineau, a once-feared football juggernaut, is now happily married to JoAnn Gastineau. Mark endured numerous romantic disasters before meeting his true soulmate, and their love story exemplifies resilience. In the huge saga of Mark’s life, his love story with JoAnn takes center stage.</p><p>They began their everlasting adventure when they married in 2007, and they’ve been together for nearly 16 years. Their great friendship has endured life’s storms, demonstrating that true love can triumph over all odds. Gastineau’s transformation from a sports champion to a loving spouse is a captivating story of redemption and fresh beginnings. Mark found solace and unconditional love in the arms of his wife, JoAnn, through life’s ups and downs.</p><h2><span id=Mark_Gastineau_Has_Two_Children_from_Previous_Marriages>Mark Gastineau Has Two Children from Previous Marriages</span></h2><p>They do not have any children, however, the former had two from previous relationships. As previously stated, JoAnn was involved in a few romances. His first wife, Lisa Gastineau (D’Amico), was discovered as a teen model in her early years. The graduate of the University of Alabama majored in radio and communications.</p><p>When she was 19, she met her future husband, Mark Gastineau. Brittny Gastineau, their only child, was born on November 11, 1982, after they married in 1979. They eventually divorced in 1986. Gastineau announced his engagement to actress Brigitte Nielsen in 1988, while still married to Lisa, and he later became the father of her son, Killian Gastineau.</p><p>Mark and Nielsen split amid steroid abuse allegations, highlighting Gastineau’s lack of female contacts. Patricia Schorr is the former defensive end’s second wife. Mark married his second wife, Schorr, in September 1997. Soon after their wedding, the former NFL star, who has a history of domestic violence, was arrested for hitting and punching Patricia.</p><p>Similarly, when he went to Patricia’s Queen’s house, rang the doorbell repeatedly, and refused to leave, he was detained for breaching a court order. He was detained again in August 1999, after divorcing from Mrs. Schorr, for causing her hurt by extinguishing a lighted cigarette on her arm.</p><h2><span id=Divorce_Agreement>Divorce Agreement</span></h2><p>Mark separated from his first wife, Lisa Gastineau (D’Amico), in 1986, and their divorce was formalized in 1991. Gastineau, a former NFL All-Pro, was sentenced to pay 85 weeks of child support and other responsibilities after the court ordered him to do so. Following Mark’s departure in 1988, his ex-wife was granted divorce for cruelty and received a share of the $500,000 Jets forfeited. Lisa Gastineau (D’Amico) received $430,000 for their property and $18,500 per year in maintenance and child support as part of their divorce settlement.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
