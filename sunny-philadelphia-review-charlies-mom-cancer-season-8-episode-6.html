Dee wants money from him to see a psychic who says he&nbsp;foresees her coming into a great wealth. She easily manipulates Frank into giving her the money, despite him insisting that the guy is a scam.&nbsp;When she actually does meet with the psychic, he at first seems to be a fraud, but he’s then able to say everything about Frank exactly right, all the way down to the&nbsp;pork-chop&nbsp;bone in his left pocket.</p><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>The psychic says that Frank’s wife is still alive, which brings about the shocking realization that she faked her own death in order to steal more of his money. This leads Frank and Dee on a treasure hunt in search of the buried wealth.&nbsp;The first stop on the treasure hunt is their old house. In the backyard they dig up a box which should have been a dead dog, but is actually Frank’s old toupee. Beneath that is a wad of over $5,000 dollars. Now that it’s confirmed that Barbara was burying money, the hunt is on.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Before they can leave the house however, they’re greeted by an old friend: Mr. Juarez (see&nbsp;The Gang Gets Extreme: Home Makeover Edition.)&nbsp;It was a funny bit to see him again, but pretty sad that he had to give up the house and he’s now only cutting the grass. As Dee says “paying for what you already own. Now that’s a scam.”</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>Frank insists the rest of the money must be in his whore wife’s actual coffin, so the whole Gang heads to it, with thoughts of great riches on their minds.&nbsp;It’s here that we get most demented twist of the show. Charlie opens up the coffin, and instead of heaps of money he’s greeting by a rotting skeleton. Frank has been scheming to trick them the whole time, providing a much bigger scheme than any other of the night.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>It looks like Frank’s prank wasn’t all bad for the game, considering the shock of seeing his mother’s bones allows Dennis to feel again, and he breaks down crying.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>I’m not really sure what was going on with Dennis not feeling any emotion. It was funny to see him gain it back at the end, but the rest of the episode it just seemed oddly thrown in. Especially since Dennis always seemed to be trying to avoid emotion in the past. Back in&nbsp;Mac Fights Gay Marriage&nbsp;we find out that Dennis doesn’t, in general, have feelings, so for it to be a problem for him now stuck out a bit.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Charlie’s Mom Has Cancer&nbsp;may not be as great as some of the recent weeks, but it was another excellent episode in what is shaping up to be the funniest season of&nbsp;<strong>It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</strong>&nbsp;yet.</p><h4 data-injectable=false><strong>Other Random Notes</strong></h4><ul data-current-count=1155 data-injectable=true><li>“When most people think of a doctor, they don’t think of a black man, living in a garage, surrounded by house plants.”</li><li>Mac’s parents never letting him watch The Cosby Show is hilarious.</li><li>I love that Dr. Jinx sprayed Mac with pesticide.</li><li>“You’re telling me that you believe that Christ comes back to life every Sunday in the form of a bowl of crackers?”</li><li>I really don’t think Frank was losing the shoes because he’s old, I think him and Charlie have just huffed too much glue.</li><li>“Mother Nature don’t play!”</li></ul><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>Be sure to check back next week for a review on the next episode of&nbsp;<strong>It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</strong>.</p>Pages: <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>1</a> <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>2</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wc2nsGaomJ65orDEpaehoZFiv6bCyJ6uZpuYlr%2BttcSsZKannWKworrCnqlmq5WWwLC6jHFknqiZqLylsYxvZmtn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./judas-priests-invincible-shield-tour-2024-unleashing-the-metal-titans.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Judas Priests Invincible Shield Tour 2024, Unleashing the Metal Titans</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-chirichella-md.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Paul Chirichella, MD Hackensack, NJ</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
