Explained Relationships with Her Spouse and Others<br></p><p><strong>Martha Plimpton and River Phoenix, Were They Married? Explained Relationships with Her Spouse and Others</strong></p><p>Was River Phoenix, who is also an actor, ever Martha Plimpton’s husband? Find out more about Martha’s spouse and their relationship in the following paragraphs.</p><p>An actress from the United States of America, Martha Campbell Plimpton, better known simply as Martha Plimpton, also goes by the name Martha Plimpton. In addition, she made her debut in the feature picture Rollover (1981), and she first gained widespread recognition in Richard Donner’s The Goonies (1985).</p><p>In a similar vein, she is best known for her roles in the movies The Mosquito Coast (1986), Shy People (1987), Running on Empty (1988), Parenthood (1989), Samantha (1992), Raising Hope (2010), and Small Town Murder Songs (all in 2011).</p><figure id=attachment_61293 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-61293 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Martha Plimpton</figure><h2>Was There Ever a Marriage Between Martha Plimpton and River Phoenix?</h2><p>Martha Plimpton and River Phoenix never got married, despite the fact that they dated when they were still very young.</p><p>In the year 1985, actress Martha Plimpton became acquainted with actor River Phoenix. River Jude Phoenix was a singer and actor who was born in the United States and passed away on October 31, 1993. He was born on August 23, 1970. In spite of the fact that they did not get along well at first, after some time had passed, they began dating each other. The sources claim that Martha and River began dating in February of 1986, while they were both working together on Peter Weir’s The Mosquito Coast. In a similar vein, they both appeared in Running on Empty, which was directed by Sidney Lumet.</p><p>Unfortunately, in June of 1989, their relationship came to an end because of Phoenix’s addiction to various substances. Despite this, they managed to keep up a strong connection all the way up to his passing in 1993. Plimpton asserted later on that, “When we went our separate ways, I understood that yelling at him, arguing with him, and pleading with him would not change his behavior. He recognized that he needed to change, but he had no desire to do so.” Plimpton maintained a part-time residence in London, and the terms of her visa permitted her to remain there until 2014.</p><p>In addition, the film director Gus Van Sant wrote a Roman a clef novel called Pink, in which he asserts that Joaquin Phoenix was only a casual drug user and that the actor had a much more substantial problem with alcohol. Because he was afraid that his addictions would destroy his career in the same manner that they had destroyed his relationship with Plimpton, Phoenix had made it a point to always try to hide them. During the final year of his life, in 1993, he was romantically involved with Samantha Mathis, who had co-starred with him in The Thing Called Love. On the night when Phoenix passed away, Mathis was there with him.</p><h2>What Exactly Took Place With River Phoenix?</h2><p>Bob Forrest claims that during P’s performance, Phoenix gave him a friendly tap on the shoulder to let him know that he wasn’t feeling well and that he believed he had overdosed on something. After some time, there was a commotion inside the club, and Forrest raced outside to investigate. When he arrived, he saw Mathis screaming, and Phoenix writhing in pain on the sidewalk. Joaquin contacted the emergency services since he was unable to determine whether or not Phoenix was breathing. Rain then gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to Phoenix after he had stopped breathing.</p><p>The unfortunate situation was that Phoenix had turned cyanotic, was in cardiac arrest, and was asystolic when the paramedics arrived on the scene. They gave him medication in an effort to get his heart beating again. Flea was the one who accompanied Phoenix to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after it was determined that Phoenix was still conscious when the ambulance arrived. At the hospital, everyone’s efforts to bring Phoenix back to life were in vain.</p><p>On October 31st, 1993, at 1:51 am Pacific Daylight Time, it was announced that he had passed away. He was 23 years old. Morphine and cocaine were found in extremely high concentrations in the blood of the deceased individual, as well as a variety of other narcotics, albeit in lower percentages, as stated in the autopsy report that was finished on November 15, 1993. His untimely death was brought on by an acute intoxication with various drugs at the same time.</p><h2>Relationships that Martha Plimpton Has Had</h2><p>When she was younger, Martha Plimpton was quite the young starlet, and she enjoyed a plethora of romantic partnerships.</p><p>In addition to her career as an actress, for which she is most known for her part in The Goonies, Martha Plimpton is also an advocate for abortion rights, the personification of the traditional tomboy look, and a powerful woman in today’s society.
