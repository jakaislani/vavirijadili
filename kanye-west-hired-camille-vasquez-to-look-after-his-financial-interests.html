Earlier this month, the Donda founder was chastised for wearing a “White Lives Matter” t-shirt to the Yeezy presentation during Paris Fashion Week. Soon after, he made many anti-Semitic statements on social media, prompting the suspension of his Instagram and Twitter accounts. West has also been sued for $250 million for making inflammatory remarks concerning the death of George Floyd.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Camille-Vasquez-1.jpg alt="Camille Vasquez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>During an appearance on Drink Champs, the singer claimed Floyd died as a result of a fentanyl overdose rather than Derek Chauvin’s physical attack.
