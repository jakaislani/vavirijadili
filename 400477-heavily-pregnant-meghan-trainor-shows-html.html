While he waits for his younger sibling to arrive, he is the center of his mother's attention, and she shows love for her 2-year-old at any given chance.</p><p class=dh>Meghan Trainor shared a few pictures of herself with her son on Instagram yesterday. In the post, we see Meghan holding her little boy as they smile at the camera. Meghan wore a black dress with crystals in the shape of squares shimmering throughout.</p><p class=dh>Her son Riley Sabara wore a pair of green glasses, a few shades brighter than his green shorts. He wore a pair of powder blue clogs and a dark blue T-shirt.</p><p class=dh>In the caption, Meghan revealed that her son said "cheese," presumably when the pictures were captured. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpekGmMrNbJ/>We see Riley</a> in his mother's arms in the first five of the seven photos. He does not feature in the sixth photo but returns in the seventh photo; however, he is no longer in his mother's arms.</p><p class=dh>Meghan's baby bump is also visible in the photos; she provided insight into the length of her pregnancy—"#22weekspregnant," the singer <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpekGmMrNbJ/>said</a>. She shared a video of herself with a whining Riley on Instagram last week. We see Meghan dancing to her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/meghan-trainor-pregnant-sings-new-song-mother-with-son-riley-video-instagram/>forthcoming single</a> "Mother" while her son shows off her growing belly.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Meghan Is Soon to Become a Mother of 2</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Meghan is expecting her second child with her husband, Daryl Sabara. The singer said to PEOPLE that she is grateful for having the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/meghan-trainor-pregnant-expecting-second-baby-with-husband-daryl-sabara/>ability to get pregnant</a>. She then added that she was halfway towards her goal of four children. Meghan and her <a class="me a" href=#>"Spy Kids" star husband</a> try to tell their son that there's another child on the way by pointing to her belly.</p><p class=dh>Riley points to his belly and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/meghan-trainor-pregnant-expecting-second-baby-with-husband-daryl-sabara/>says</a>, "Baby," Megan tells her son that the baby is not in his belly but hers—an adorable story that the "All About That Bass" songstress revealed. She also showed that she experienced pregnancy symptoms much faster in her second pregnancy than in her first.</p><p class=dh>Meghan is poised to release her debut book titled "Dear Future Mama," said to be in stock from April 25. Meghan told PEOPLE that she will go into the details of her pregnancies to make people feel like they are not alone in "grossness." The book features commentary from her OB-GYN, trainer, and dietitian.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Riley Was Born in 2021</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>On February 8, 2021, Meghan gave birth to her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/meghan-trainor-husband-daryl-sabara-welcome-first-child-son-riley/>first child with Daryl</a>. The world learned about her son Riley's birth after she announced his arrival on Instagram. She wrote about the stipulated delivery date being Valentine's Day, but Riley arrived six days earlier and thanked her husband for "the best Valentine's gift ever!"</p><p class=dh>Her husband responded with the details of his son's birth weight, saying that Riley was seven pounds and eight ounces at birth and also showing appreciation for his partner, who he called his "Forever Valentine." Meghan's first childbirth was through a C-section.</p><p class=dh>Meghan was once rumored to be a triplet, but although she does have two other siblings, they were not conceived together, as she finds herself as the <a class="me a" href=#>middle child between two boys</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1naWxnbHqpscCvoKWxXaW%2FprPNmqWtZZ2atKmtzWarq5mZo7yzedKhprCrXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kehlani-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kehlani Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./golnesa-gg-gharachedaghi.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Golnesa Gg Gharachedaghi</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
