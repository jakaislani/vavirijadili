Sadly, their union was short-lived and didn’t stand the test of time. They got separated in November 2019 and finalized their divorce in May 2020. But before then, they welcome two children: a son named Caleb and a daughter named Chloe.</p><p>Nothing much is known about the kids except that Caleb was born in 2016 and Chloe in 2018.

She was born in the year 1985 in her hometown in Upstate, New York, United States of America. It is not known when exactly she celebrates her birthdays.</p><h3><strong>Did Raphael Warnock Run Over His Wife?</strong></h3><p>Raphael Warnock most likely did not run over his ex-wife. In March 2020, while they were still going through their divorce proceedings, Oulèye Ndoye accused her ex-husband Warnock of running over her foot with his car during an argument, but Raphael denied the accusation. The argument was regarding whether their children would travel to Senegal to visit Oulèye’s family. Upon the arrival of police at the scene, Ndoye was found very reluctant to show the responding police officers her foot.</p><p>However, when she eventually did, the officers “did not see any signs that Ms. Ouleye’s foot was run over”. According to Warnock, his ex was standing by the car when he slowly drove away, and he did not think he ran over her foot. It did not stop there; medical practitioners were also called to the scene, and upon arrival, they were unable to find any signs of injury on Ndoye’s foot. Hence, the police did not charge Warnock with any crime relating to the incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571Kxmpp2VqXqzrc%2BhmJ6kXayus7rOnKKsZZWteri1xZ5kqK2cmsamec2dprKdXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-creamed-corn.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Creamed Corn, Really?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeon-jungkook-bts-style-golden-maknae.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeon Jungkook's Golden Style Moves</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
