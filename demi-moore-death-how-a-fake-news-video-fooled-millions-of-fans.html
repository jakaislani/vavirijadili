She wrote:</p><p>I am alive and well. Thank you for your love and support. God bless you all.</p><p>She also posted a video on Instagram, where she sang a snippet of her song “Landslide” and said:</p><p>I just want to say thank you for all of your love and support. I’m doing fine. I’m here at home, and I’m just enjoying life. And I want you to do the same. God bless you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Current Projects and Plans of Moore</h2><p>Moore, who is best known for her roles in Indecent Proposal, Ghost, and A Few Good Men, is one of the most acclaimed and influential actresses of all time. She has won two Golden Globes, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She is also the highest-paid actress to that point, receiving $12.5 million to star in Striptease.</p><p>The 61-year-old actress is still active and busy with her acting career. She recently starred in the limited series Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, where she played socialite Ann Woodward. She also appeared in the comedy film Corporate Animals, where she played a CEO who leads her staff on a team-building retreat.
