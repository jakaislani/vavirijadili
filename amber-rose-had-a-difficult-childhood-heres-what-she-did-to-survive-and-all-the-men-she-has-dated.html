She is also a former stripper known for dating famous rappers like Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa whom she later married. An activist and feminist, Rose championed the 2015 L.A SlutWalk which agitated against rape and sexual harassment.</p><p>The young lady has experienced such assaults several times and has revealed a very traumatic incident that involves a boy in high school; it was only one of the many ugly things Amber had to face during her early years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=amber-rose-began-stripping-as-a-teenager></span><strong>Amber Rose Began Stripping as a Teenager</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born Amber Levonchuck on October 21, 1983, in Philadelphia, United States, Rose was raised in the Southside of the city by her parents. Her mother is of mixed ethnicity as she half-Cape Verdean and half-Scottish while her father is also a mixed breed of Irish and Italian ancestry. Apart from her, the TV personality’s parents had only one other child, her brother Antonio Hewlett.</p><p>Rose’s parents, Dorothy Rose and Michael Levonchuck, a former military official, got divorced when she was only six years old, leaving little Amber and her mother in a dire situation. Rose once revealed that they were broke and homeless when her dad left.</p><p>At age 15, she took to the streets to seek for jobs to support her family. Amber began to strip at night clubs with the name Paris and even attempted to sell cocaine but that did not turn out too well for her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-childhood-experience-that-inspired-la-slutwalk></span><strong>The Childhood Experience That Inspired L.A SlutWalk</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amber Rose championed the popular L.A SlutWalk on October 3rd, 2015 to debunk the idea that the sexuality of women can be subject to ridicule without any form of repercussions.</p><p>She revealed during the event a degrading prank a boy played on her when she was 14. According to the TV personality, the boy who happened to be her classmate pulled his pants down to expose his genitals when they were locked in the closet during a “7 Minutes in Heaven” kissing game.</p><p>He allegedly made her kneel while facing his genitals and opened the door of the closet as soon she was down on her knees, exposing her to all their friends who assumed the pair had oral sex in the closet. However, her humiliation did not end there as she had to deal with a lot of bullies for a while after that ordeal.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=things-got-better-when-she-started-modelling></span><strong>Things Got Better When She Started Modelling</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Apart from her stripping job, Amber was also appearing on music videos and according to her, she remembers the experience as invigorating and the best times of her life; with no regrets at all for following that part. It was during one of her appearances on music videos that she caught the attention of Kanye West after he saw her on Ludacris’ music video for What Them Girls Like.</p><p>Speaking about the experience, Rose said when she first got a call from West, she thought it was a scam until the call came in twice and the rapper invited her over to Los Angeles to star in his Robocop video. The video was never released but then, she escorted West to the 2008 Grammy Awards and ended up working for a lot of other big shots in showbiz.</p><p>A notable appearance she made back then was in the music video, Put On (2008), by Young Jeezy and Kanye West. She subsequently gained more prominence after posing for the French fashion house and luxury retail company, Louis Vuitton, and West’s sneaker line. This was followed by walking the runway at New York Fashion Week; making cameos in music videos for Nicki Minaj, Wiz Khalifa, Fabolous, Ludacris, and many others which further integrated her into showbiz.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=amber-roses-marriage-and-divorce-from-wiz-khalifa></span><strong>Amber Rose’s Marriage and Divorce from Wiz Khalifa</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rose and the rapper dated for about two years before getting married on the 8th of July 2013. This was a few months after the birth of their son Sebastian Taylor Thomaz; he was born on February 21st, 2013.</p><p>However, her marriage with the rapper lasted until September 22, 2014, before Rose filed for divorce from him citing irreconcilable differences. She went on to seek sole custody for their son but that was not approved and they currently have joint custody.</p><p>Sebastian is not the only child of the model as she welcomed a second son with the music executive Alexandra Edwards in 2018. The pair who were friends since 2015 started a romantic relationship in 2018 which they made public by October that year via Instagram.</p><p>Ever since then, they have been very public about their love, and with the birth of their son Slash Alexandra Edwards in October 2019, their relationship keeps getting stronger. They even got their heads tattooed recently in honor of Amber’s 2 kids.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-look-at-other-popular-men-shes-dated></span><strong>A Look at Other Popular Men She’s Dated</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Apart from her marriage to Wiz Khalifa and her current relationship with Alexandra Edwards, the model has dated other popular figures. She has been in one too many flings with celebrities like James Harden, Machine Gun Kelly, Amiyah Scott, Chris Brown, and others.</p><p>With regards to the men she has dated in the past, here is a quick insight into her dating history:</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=monte-morris-2018></span><strong>Monte Morris (2018)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Before her relationship with Alexandra, the model was dating the NBA player Monte Morris and they were seen together most of the time during the summer of 2018. However, their relationship ended that same year for reasons that were not made known to the public. The only reason people could come up with was that Amber left the young man for Alexandra. It has also been speculated that Monte ended the relationship to concentrate on his career.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=21-savage-2017-%e2%80%93-2018></span><strong>21 Savage (2017 – 2018)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Amber Rose and 21 Savage were an item between 2017 and 2018. The pair were first seen together in the summer of 2017 and sometime in July that year, they were already flaunting their love as they were seen wearing similar diamond wristwatches.</p><p>The rapper also revealed in an interview with Real 92.3 in Los Angeles that Rose is a very loving lady who has had a good influence on him: she made him take his vitamins and drink water regularly. Albeit, the relationship met its end in March 2018.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=val-chmerkovskiy-2016-%e2%80%93-2017></span><strong>Val Chmerkovskiy (2016 – 2017)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Val Chmerkovskiy and Amber Rose met when she danced with his brother Maksim on Dancing With the Stars Season 23. She later went on to date Val for about 5 months before they broke up in February 2017. The reason for their split also remains unknown to the public but from what was gathered, the pair ended the relationship amicably. Val even took to his Instagram page to praise Amber for being a wonderful soul even though they were no longer together.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=odell-beckham-jr-2015-%e2%80%93-2017></span><strong>Odell Beckham, Jr. (2015 – 2017)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Amber and Odell Beckham sparked rumors of being a couple sometime in 2017 although a lot of people had been suspicious of their friendship since 2015. In 2017, the duo was spotted at Coachella snuggling with each other in ways that suggest they were more than just platonic friends. According to the model, she and Odell were very close friends and she even considers him one of her best friends.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kanye-west-2008-%e2%80%93-2010></span><strong>Kanye West (2008 – 2010)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kanye West was among the first big names Amber Rose was linked to. The pair initially became an item in 2008 and were together for about 2 years before their dramatic split in 2010. They exchanged a couple of awkward tweets at the time their relationship crashed but eventually settled their differences and are in good terms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmdl7KzedGoqp5lmJaxbq2MnaCfnpmYwq3AjJyfoqSUnbywsIyhnKudo2LEqa3TZqqhnV2ZtqV506hkrK2iq7a3sYyapZ1lkaG5bsDHnmSmnZ5iwKmxjKGYrGWUlsGmsI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./giorgia-whigham.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Giorgia Whigham Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1142-angel-number-meaning-and-symbolism.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>1142 Angel Number Meaning and Symbolism</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
