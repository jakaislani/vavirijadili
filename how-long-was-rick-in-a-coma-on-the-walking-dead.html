At the core of the story for many seasons was Sheriff Deputy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rick Grimes</a> who, in the pilot episode, awakens from a coma to post-apocalyptic horror.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Following his lonely awakening, Rick ventures through the hospital just to find that he is the only sign of humanity in the vicinity. Luckily, Rick <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eventually stumbles upon Glenn Rhee</a> (Steven Yeun), and soon joins together with a group of other survivors as they all attempt to outlast the apocalyptic world.</p><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>Flashbacks are shown throughout the first season, revealing that Rick ended up in a comatose state at the hospital after being shot in the shoulder while attempting to capture criminals with his partner and long-time friend Shane Walsh. In the webseries episode “The Oath,” it’s revealed that Rick was likely kept alive during his coma by Dr Gale Macones who, after the U.S. army and fellow employees abandoned the hospital, stayed behind to care for sick patients who had no other hope.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>However, the timeline of events is not entirely clear, including the duration of Rick’s presence in the hospital, and continues to be heavily debated.</p><h2 id=so-how-long-was-rick-in-a-coma data-injectable=false>So, how long was Rick in a coma?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/walking-dead.png><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>The exact time of how long Rick was in his comatose state is fuzzy, with some speculating that it was a little over a month, while others suggest that it was closer to two months. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider</a>, the Fear the Walking Dead showrunner explained that Robert Kirkman, co-creator of The Walking Dead, has said that Rick Grimes was in his coma for between four and five weeks, or a little over a month.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Moreover, the show’s pilot episode indicates that Shane had been checking on Rick for a few weeks after he entered his coma. In an interesting turn of events, Rick later realizes that Shane and Rick’s wife Lori have begun a romantic relationship after the duo assumed that Rick would never wake up.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>On the other hand, many fans and critics alike find the details of Rick’s coma to be relatively hard to believe, considering that he was able to survive for weeks without actual food or water. However, that’s where it’s easy to believe the theory of Dr. Macones nursing Rick back to health in his time of need. Many speculate that Rick’s malnutrition ironically awakened him from his coma, which is why he was alone in the hospital after everyone else either fled or died.</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=150 data-injectable=false>For those wishing to travel back down memory lane and witness Rick awaken from his coma, The Walking Dead is available to stream right now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9Zmo6iml2LEor%2BMq6Cco12eu26tjJymppldpLtuwMeeZLCZnKC2r7OMnZyanF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-chuck-clark-dead-or-alive-did-he-committed-suicide.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Chuck Clark Dead or Alive?
