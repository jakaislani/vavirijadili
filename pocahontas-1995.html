Governor Ratcliffe (<a href=#>David Ogden Stiers</a>), the blustering leader of the Virginia Company, is shown gleefully using cannons to level forests. And when the settlers open fire on the Indians, they retaliate by capturing John Smith and then prepare to execute him. Only Pocahontas, who can empathize with both sides, can save the day.</p><p>"Pocahontas" is based on myth, not history. In real life, Pocahontas was 11 or 12 when she first met John Smith (who claimed in his journals that his life was saved no less than three times by women who loved him). The Englishman she married was John Rolfe. She did indeed get to go to England, where she was feted as a princess.</p><p>She died in Europe, at about age 21. The son she had with Rolfe became one of the richest of early American settlers, and his descendants still thrive.</p><p>Having led one of the most interesting lives imaginable, Pocahontas serves here more as a simplified symbol, an Indian maid who falls in love with a dashing blond hero, saves his life, and brings about a peace between her people and the European visitors.</p><p>The dramatic challenge in the movie (as it is in "<a href=#>The Little Mermaid</a>") is that her father disapproves of the man she loves, because he belongs to a different race. He wants her to marry a member of the tribe, whom she dislikes because "he's so . . .</p><p>serious." When her intended is shot dead by a young British soldier and Smith is taken prisoner, her immediate thought is, "I'll never see John Smith again!" So much for any lingering regrets over the dead fiancé.</p><p>The movie hurries on to the big picture, which is that Pocahontas, raised in communion with nature, can help John Smith free himself of the moral constipation of European civilization. "You can't step in the same river twice," he learns, and "listen with your heart, and you will understand." Since these lessons are taught by an Indian maiden with a waist-length mane of black hair, an hourglass figure and a Playmate face, John Smith's heart finds it easy to listen, and soon he is singing a hymn to the new land. (He does not, however, sing a love duet with Pocahontas, because the romantic theme "If I Never Knew You" was cut from the movie, reportedly because the kids in test audiences found it boring. Without such a transition, their relationship emerges rather abruptly.) What is especially good about "Pocahontas" is the artistry of the animation. The big picture - the new land of towering forests, sparkling streams and rugged cliffs - is drawn with a freedom and energy that has real power. And, as in "The Lion King," the landscape includes a precipice from which the characters can survey their domain - a rock jutting out into the sky, making an ideal pulpit for sweeping sentiments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46pppyZmKS7ta3SZmhycWU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dark-night-2017.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dark Night movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2017)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./manuel-garcia-rulfo-height-how-tall-is-manuel-garcia-rulfo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Manuel Garcia-Rulfo Height: How Tall Is Manuel Garcia-Rulfo?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
