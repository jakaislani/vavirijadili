You guessed it right. We are taking of Robin (played by <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maya Hawke</a></strong>) who throughout the show’s run became an instant favorite amongst the fans.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>When the show first introduced Robin, her excellent chemistry with co-worker Steve Harrington led many to believe them as potential love interests, only for surprise them with the reveal of Robin’s sexual orientation.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>Turns out that Robin is a lesbian who found a new romantic partner in her classmate, Vickie. It goes without saying that Hawke delivered an outstanding performance that continues to receive critical acclaim even to this day. So much so that, her flawless representation has sparked curiosity among many fans about her sexual orientation giving rise to an obvious question.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-maya-hawke-s-sexuality data-injectable=false><strong>What is Maya Hawke’s sexuality?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Untitled-design-2-6.png><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>While Hawke is usually synonymized with Stranger Things’ Robin, her portrayal of queer characters isn’t just limited to the show. She is well-known for having played a queer character in another well-known work of hers, Do Revenge, where she plays the teenage, tomboyish girl, Eleanor in a relationship with her friend’s twin sister, Gabbi.</p><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>With the greater degree of realness that she brought to both the roles earning her immense fame and stardom, people are interested to know her take on the LGBTQIA characters that she’s so keen on playing. However, there’s no evidence of her being gay, as the actress hasn’t confirmed anything yet on this subject. Neither has she gone absolutely public about her dating life, which might have given some more specific idea about her sexuality. Concerning her dating life, up till now, she has reportedly dated men, and was rumored to be romantically involved with The Sandman star, Tom Sturridge in July 2022.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>Despite her sexuality being open to speculation, we wish to see more of Hawke in LGBTQIA roles in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnMmrCaZZiWxKyxjKCYsmWYmr9uv8SxrJqkmanGbq%2FOpqeaqpWZerW7jKGcq2WcnK%2B1vciaZJygkaeupMDEq6pmnailuaK1zZ6baA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jackson-garton-obituary-death-to-car-accident.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jackson Garton Obituary And Death Linked To Car Accident</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./denise-grayson-wikipedia-biography-age-robert-forster-girlfriend-is-she-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Denise Grayson Wikipedia, Biography, Age: Robert Forster Girlfriend, Is She Married?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
