Following the impending conclusion of season 6 — which airs its finale on March 6 and its reunion a week later, on March 13 — the show will shift focus to a new location, and fans are already invested.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=676 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Much of that investment is the result of premature drama, rather than real interest in the show’s supposed aims. Its become an increasingly prevalent issue the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deeper Love is Blind gets into its seasons</a> that participants ditch the show’s love-seeking purpose for more selfish motivations. Love is Blind has proved itself to be a star-maker, as singles on earlier seasons find easy reality fame in the wake of their participation, and that’s shifted how the show is treated. Once, it was a pure, creative, and genuinely intriguing experiment. Now, its a quick path to reality fame, and that’s how many of its recent stars treat their tenure on the show.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>That issue could spell the end of Love is Blind eventually, but so long as people keep showing up to watch, Netflix will keep putting out seasons. Even as it grapples with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely messy men of season 6</a>, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">still-pending lawsuits of season 5</a>, and the already-blossoming drama of season 7, which is set to gather singles from Minneapolis for yet another attempt to prove that love really is blind.</p><h2 id=h-love-is-blind-season-7-drama-explained data-injectable=false>Love is Blind season 7 drama, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@hopeyoufindyourdad href=#>@hopeyoufindyourdad</a><p>@Andra you think your dating life is hard?

But shows take a long time to make, and pretty much the moment filming began in Minneapolis, rumors about the eventual season were popping off. Rumors are largely swirling around the participants prepped to show up in season 7, and they’re spreading like wildfire as season 6 comes to a close.</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Few specific names have been dropped when discussing participants for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Minneapolis season</a> of Love is Blind, but there is plenty of chatter about just who will find themselves in the pods. This chatter is largely stemming from Minneapolis natives, some of whom are bracing themselves to see familiar faces on the next season of the Netflix show. One TikTok user, in particular, spurred conversations when she shared her tearful take on Netflix’s casting process.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>That casting process already came under fire in season 6, after a number of the men involved were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exposed as cheaters and liars</a>, and their pre-casting relationships were revealed. It seems Netflix has yet to learn a necessary lesson, as people from Minneapolis pile onto the show with newfound criticism of the vetting process.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true><a title=@hopeyoufindyourdad href=#>@hopeyoufindyourdad</a><p>@Andra is there a point in which boys and dating ever get better?

After discovering that an ex was among the rumored cast members, @hopeyoufindyourdad took to her TikTok page to warn women away, and to blast Netflix for casting “horrible people” for the incoming season.</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=false>Its still unclear exactly who Andra is talking about, but I imagine more clarity will come once the season is actually airing. She’s uncertain as to how much she’s at liberty to discuss, presently, but the gloves are sure to come off once she sees her ex’s face on the small screen in a few months. There are claims about the identity of the man in question, but, until we have official confirmation of his identity, we won’t be perpetuating any potentially damaging rumors here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S5sMLEZqCsZZKhtq%2BwjKagp6aVlr2wuMisZKWdkaDAbr7Upqarq12Wu6V5w6uYppldlq%2Bwwc2dZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tsa-mask-mandate-extended-september-13-travel-covid-19-2021-5.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TSA Extends Mask Mandate to September 13 for Planes, Buses, and Trains</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./karen-allen-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Karen Allen Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
