Given their age difference, it would be going too far to describe this moment as love at first sight. Amy (<a href=#>Melanie Lynskey</a>), depressed by divorce and a feeling her life has no purpose, finds she cannot endure one more moment. She leaves the table. Jeremy (<a href=#>Christopher Abbott</a>) follows her. And then, whatddaya know, for his part, it was love at first sight. He makes this urgently clear. She is blindsided and confused. But Jeremy burns with such a bright spark, it is enough to ignite them both.</p><p>"Hello, I Must Be Going" is a whimsical comedy about their developing relationship. She resists strongly, not because she doesn't like the young man but because she finds their age difference impossible now and feels it will only grow more so over time.</p><p>No, this isn't a film about the double standard by which we accept men with much younger partners but not when it's the other way around. It's more one of those films that depend for humor in situations in which the central couple is threatened by discovery and embarrassment. Those are risks Jeremy, in the fullness of love, willingly accepts. Amy has just failed at an "appropriate" relationship and now is confronted by this … strangeness.</p><p>Her mother, Ruth (<a href=#>Blythe Danner</a>), who has always been critical, now is appalled, not least because Amy seems to be sabotaging the deal that would allow husband Stan (<a href=#>John Rubinstein</a>) to settle his affairs and afford to retire. Now there's a guilt trip for you. As for Jeremy's mother, Gwen (<a href=#>Julie White</a>), though therapists are trained to be non-judgmental, my guess is she might be happier if her son had turned out gay.</p><p>How do we feel about the romance? This is always a tricky test. The movies so strongly encourage identification that male viewers are presumably required to decide if they find Amy attractive. On that I think a great deal might depend on their own age. Melanie Lynskey (as a human being, not a character) is certainly sweet, cuddly and glows in this performance, but does she generate a sexual gravitation transcending age? A few actresses have all but set up shop as women of a certain age who attract younger lovers. I think of <a href=#>Susan Sarandon</a>, <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> and <a href=#>Isabelle Huppert</a>. With Melanie Lynskey, the irresistibility must be in the eye of the beholder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hnKWkn2K2brnUrKtmmpVitLC1zaBka2hhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-long-was-rick-in-a-coma-on-the-walking-dead.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How long was Rick in a coma on The Walking Dead?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./malumas-girlfriend-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Malumas Recent Girlfriend?
