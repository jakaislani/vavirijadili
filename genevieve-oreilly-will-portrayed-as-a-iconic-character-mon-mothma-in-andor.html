In 2003, O’Reilly debuted in the character in a deleted scene from Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. She has spent most of her time in Star Wars Rebels providing voice dubs for the character. The actress felt that she got the first true opportunity to explore the character in depth with Andor.</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“To be able to investigate and dive into her — not only as a Rebel commander but also as a woman — has been something I didn’t anticipate and something I’m glad to be a part of.”</p><p>She went on:</p><p>“Caroline [Blakiston’s Mon Mothma] held visible anguish in the heart and core of that moment, I always thought. So I’ve always been fascinated about what that suffering was,…and having the chance to find out would hopefully inform and enhance the work that currently exists.”</p><h2>Who exactly is Genevieve O’Reilly?</h2><p>Genevieve O’Reilly was born on January 6, 1977, in Dublin, Ireland. She is the oldest of four siblings and was reared in Adelaide, Australia. The actress relocated to Sydney when she was 20 years old. She graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 2000.&nbsp;Genevieve O’Reilly made her television debut in 2001 with the Canadian series BeastMaster. She then made a cameo in Asylum Seekers. She came to notoriety as Leanne Curtis in All Saints. The program ran from 2002 through 2005.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Genevieve-OReilly-2.jpg alt="Genevieve O'Reilly" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She has appeared on The State Within, The Time of Your Life, Diana: Last Days of a Princess, Second Chance, Life, Spooks, Waking the Dead, The Day of the Triffids, Law & Order: UK, and Midsomer Murders, among other shows.&nbsp;Genevieve O’Reilly earned a name for herself as Frances Pirsig in the miniseries The Honourable Woman.

She stated about her part in Andor and the chance to delve into the character:</p><p>“This is such a wonderful part. It has been an honor to step into the shoes that Caroline Blakiston created with George Lucas in the 1980s, as well as to revisit her at various points in my life. So having the opportunity to explore and delve into her — not just as a Rebel leader, but also as a woman — has been unexpected and something I’m excited to be a part of.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGienqaVq7amwsRmpqudmaG5unnWoqOlZaCkv7W%2BwLKcnWWRqHqiecicpqehk2Kwqa3RmpqtnaJiurC6jKamraCdlnqquoyapZ2nomQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./koe-wetzel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Koe Wetzel</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zina-garrison-net-worth-age-height-bio-husband-net-worth-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zina Garrison Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Husband, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./helena-hoffman-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Helena Hoffman Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./great-movie-the-man-who-laughs-1928.html>The Man Who Laughs movie review (1928)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./will-john-dutton-be-killed-off-of-yellowstone-the-best-exit-strategies-for-kevin-costner.html>Will John Dutton be killed off of Yellowstone?
